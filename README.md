# GNU-seL4-RPi3
collection to set up seL4 on the RPi3. I'll be porting gnu applications to this soon.
Credits to seL4 developers for working thier asses off, I should probably include those references in a folder.
I'll be tring to port a bunch of applications.
bash
zsh
wayland
i3
a terminal emulator
compositor like compton
feh
pulse audio
I just need to understand how seL4 works before that.
